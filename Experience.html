                                but the certification was mostly based around vanilla javascript OOP in the DOM</li>

                                focused on AWS. Learning the meta view of the platform, learning what their products do,
                                pricing, availability and labs deploying instances with use of some products.</li>

                                are familiar with the SalesForce Transit Station, we build the "curtain" which is the
                                alluminum outter "shell." It's alluminum with geometric cutouts here is a photo. Also

                                some of the inner soffit.</li>

                                Center in Springfield, MO. I was
                                also able to work in Las Vegas building stages for EDC. These were amazing experiences
                                that taught me team work, safety, attention to detail and working in a dynamic
                                environment with a lot going on. I've attached a photo to one of the stages I helped
                                errect.
                                It is really hard to put to scale in a photo. One of the most exciting jobs of my life.

                                almost 3 years now. I have learned a lot about the manufacturing process. I have
                                researched "Lean 6 Sigma" practices and it really drives a lot of my projects today.
                                I know that it was created around manufacturing practices, saving time, logging
                                everything, doing your best to be as efficeint as possible. I think that is extremely
                                important. Here I've mostly worked with the production schedule. I meet with supervisors
                                to ensure we had consistent runs with very little downtime. Providing tools, repairing
                                tooling, ensuring inks are created correctly, and much more!
